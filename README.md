# Intelligent Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## Overview
The **Intelligent Crop Recommendation System** leverages **machine learning** to help farmers select the most suitable crops based on soil and environmental conditions. By analyzing factors such as **soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall**, the system predicts the optimal crop to maximize yield and sustainability.

## Features
- **Data-driven crop recommendations** based on soil properties and climatic conditions.
- **Machine Learning models** trained on agricultural datasets.
- **Flask-based Web Application** for user interaction.
- **Pre-trained ML models** for accurate and efficient predictions.
- **Scalable and extendable** for future improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH Level
- Rainfall
- Crop Label (Target Variable)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN)
- **Flask** (For web-based user interaction)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For model training and evaluation)
