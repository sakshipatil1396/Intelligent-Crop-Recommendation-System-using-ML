The "Intelligent Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning" is designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on specific agricultural parameters. By analyzing soil properties such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) levels, pH, as well as environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system leverages machine learning algorithms to provide tailored crop recommendations. This data-driven approach aims to enhance crop yield and promote sustainable farming practices.

The project repository includes several key components:

- **Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) containing historical agricultural data used to train and test the machine learning models.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive notebook (`Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning.ipynb`) that details the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation processes.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained models (`model.pkl`) and associated scalers (`minmaxscaler.pkl`, `standscaler.pkl`) that facilitate the prediction of suitable crops based on input parameters.

- **Web Application**: A Flask-based application (`app.py`) that provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to input soil and environmental data and receive crop recommendations.

By integrating machine learning techniques into agriculture, this system offers farmers actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making to optimize crop selection and improve overall productivity.
